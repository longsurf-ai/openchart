# scheduler

Owns best-effort dispatch. See [scheduler contract](../../docs/architecture/scheduler.md).

- Service.runLoop owns scanning; runNow admits immediately even when disabled,
  preserving definition/cursor. Layer registration starts no work; background.ts
  owns the scoped loop, interrupted and joined before dependencies close.
- Scans fix a cutoff, read Schedule/Occurrence through intrinsic listAll in one
  read transaction, filter eligibility, and sort by nextFireAt/id. Admit sequentially
  after that transaction; never await Run execution or starve later fires.
- Intent is schedule:<scheduleId>:<fireAt>. AgentRunStore.getByIntent supplies the
  accepted Session/input on retry; edits never replace it.
- Manual fireAt uses the server clock.
- Admit prompts via admitPromptTarget; `data_collection` targets via Collection,
  checking the Occurrence first (scripts have no Run). Session
  resolution, Run admission, ensureOccurrence, and cursor advancement remain separate
  commits. Never wrap them in one transaction or duplicate their rules.
- Record acceptance idempotently, then advance the cursor only if selected revision
  and cursor still match. Preserve concurrent edits, pauses, deletion.
- Cron resumes at the next future instant without replaying missed intervals.
  Accepted one-time fires are exhausted without changing user-authored enabled state.
- Scan failures log and retry; manual errors and defects/interruption propagate.
  Agent owns execution and crash recovery.
- Test public Service with isolated SQLite/TestClock; expose no test-only APIs.
