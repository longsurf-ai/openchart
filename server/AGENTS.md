# server

Owns application composition and transports. See
[architecture](../docs/architecture/code-organization.md).

<!-- HUMAN-ANNOTATION:START -->

Each service belongs in `<folder-name>/<folder-name>.ts`, which is the service
entry point for that directory.

Before changing code under `server/`, think carefully about whether Effect can
substantially simplify the work.
<!-- HUMAN-ANNOTATION:END -->

- `index.ts` alone composes root tRPC/Hose routes. Features export handlers and
  child routers; hosts choose ports. `createServer` returns an unbound server;
  `access` guards requests and Hose upgrades with one predicate (bound Host,
  trusted Origin, per-run token); CORS answers that origin only.
- `runtime.ts` owns one application Layer/ManagedRuntime. Initialize before
  listening; dispose on startup failure. Shutdown closes Hose, HTTP, then runtime;
  owner-scoped fibers finish cleanup first. Procedures never construct services or Layers.
  Agent recovery repairs abandoned execution before queues wake; Scheduler
  background starts after it succeeds. Recovery failure blocks readiness.
- Server contracts use Effect Schema; applied migrations are frozen.
  Parse wire input once, execute Effect internally, expose ordinary values.
- `lib/trpc` owns shared context/builders; `lib/errors` owns public error policy
  for tRPC and Hose; never expose stacks or raw defects.
- `db` owns application SQLite. Stores use its connection or caller transaction;
  Database detects commits, Resource maps events, `events` delivers.
- `resources/catalog.ts` is shared by transports, tools, and prompts;
  `lib/resource` stays transport-independent.
- `agent` owns execution; `models` owns the scoped provider registry;
  `feed` composes Datasets; `scheduler` owns dispatch. `alert` records Tea fires,
  `bus` carries ids between services, `trigger` runs targets, `notification`
  is a host capability, `monitoring` holds user-facing health. See
  [alert-trigger](../docs/architecture/alert-trigger.md). `proactive` offers
  next steps before the user asks.
- [access](access/AGENTS.md) owns Credential, Integration, Auth, and Billing;
  [OpenChart Provider](data/providers/openchart/AGENTS.md) owns its remote transport.
  Lifecycles stay distinct.
- App imports only types from `contract.ts`; server never imports app/platform
  code. Test Providers stay in tests.
