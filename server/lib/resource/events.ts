 * Deletion retains the deleted row's revision. Equal revisions must not
 * suppress invalidation: the entity may no longer exist.

 * ```ts
 * yield* events.publish(ResourceChanged, {resource: 'dashboard', id, revision});

 * @param events - The application's shared event publisher.
 * @returns A callback satisfying Database's committed-change contract.
