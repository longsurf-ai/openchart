// Purpose: Resolves an operation before executing its apply phase in one database transaction.

/**
 * Resolves external facts, then runs apply in one Database transaction.
 *
 * Resolve failure opens no transaction. Apply failure or a defect rolls back
 * its database writes; Database owns commit and subsequent change delivery.
 * Resource semantics and composition belong to the supplied transition.
 * Call this once at the execution boundary, never from another apply phase.
 *
 * @param transition - Input-bound resolve and apply phases to execute.
 * @returns The apply result, preserving resolver, apply, and database failures.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const created = yield* Transactor.run(
 *   dashboardResource.transitions.create(body),
 * );
 * ```
